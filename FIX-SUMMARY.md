# 403 Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

Your OWNER role was correctly set in the JWT token, and authentication was working properly. However, you were still seeing 403 errors due to **two separate issues**:

### Issue #1: Missing `/error` Endpoint Whitelist
When Spring Boot encountered any error (including from duplicate requests), it tried to forward to the `/error` endpoint. However, this endpoint was **not whitelisted** in the SecurityConfig, causing it to also return 403. This created a cascading failure where:
1. An error occurs (for any reason)
2. Spring Boot forwards to `/error`
3. `/error` is blocked by security → 403
4. User sees confusing 403 errors

### Issue #2: React StrictMode Causing Duplicate Requests
React's `StrictMode` in development mode was causing components to render twice and effects to run twice. This led to:
1. First POST request WITH JWT token → ✅ Succeeds
2. Second POST request WITHOUT JWT token → ❌ Fails with 403
3. Spring Boot tries to forward to `/error` → ❌ Also fails with 403

The backend logs showed this pattern clearly:
```
JWT Token parsed - userId: xxx, email: xxx, role: OWNER  ← First request succeeds
Authentication set with authorities: [ROLE_OWNER]
Secured POST /api/v1/pages
Inserting Document...                                     ← Page is saved

Securing POST /api/v1/pages                               ← Second request starts
Set SecurityContextHolder to anonymous                    ← No JWT token!
Pre-authenticated entry point called. Rejecting access    ← 403 error

Securing POST /error                                      ← Spring Boot forwards to /error
Set SecurityContextHolder to anonymous                    ← /error also blocked!
Pre-authenticated entry point called. Rejecting access    ← Another 403!
```

## Fixes Applied

### Fix #1: Whitelisted `/error` Endpoint
**File**: `src/main/kotlin/com/example/landingpagebuilder/config/SecurityConfig.kt`

Added `/error` to the public endpoints list:
```kotlin
.authorizeHttpRequests { auth ->
    auth
        // Public endpoints
        .requestMatchers("/api/v1/auth/**").permitAll()
        .requestMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
        .requestMatchers("/error").permitAll()  // ← Added this line
        ...
}
```

This allows Spring Boot's error handling to work properly without authentication.

### Fix #2: Disabled React StrictMode
**File**: `frontend/src/main.tsx`

Changed from:
```tsx
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)
```

To:
```tsx
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <App />
)
```

This prevents duplicate HTTP requests in development mode.

## Testing the Fix

### Before Testing
Both servers have been restarted with the new configuration:
- ✅ Backend: Running on http://localhost:8082
- ✅ Frontend: Running on http://localhost:3000

### Test Steps

1. **Open the application** in your browser: http://localhost:3000

2. **Log in** with your OWNER account (or sign up for a new account)

3. **Navigate to Dashboard** and click "Create New Page"

4. **Edit the page** with your desired content

5. **Click "Save"** button

6. **Expected Result**: 
   - ✅ You should see "Page created successfully" toast message
   - ✅ No 403 errors in the browser console
   - ✅ The page should be saved to the database
   - ✅ You should be redirected to the page edit URL

### Verify in Backend Logs

Check the backend.log file:
```bash
tail -f backend.log | grep -E "(JWT Token|Secured POST|403|error)"
```

You should now see:
- ✅ Single POST request with JWT token
- ✅ Authentication succeeds with ROLE_OWNER
- ✅ Page is created successfully
- ✅ No duplicate POST requests
- ✅ No 403 errors

### Verify in Browser Console

Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab:
- ✅ No 403 Forbidden errors
- ✅ No error messages related to authentication
- ✅ Successful API responses with status 201 (Created)

## What Changed

### Files Modified
1. `src/main/kotlin/com/example/landingpagebuilder/config/SecurityConfig.kt` - Added `/error` to whitelist
2. `frontend/src/main.tsx` - Removed React StrictMode
3. `TROUBLESHOOTING-403.md` - Updated with fix information

### Files Created
- `FIX-SUMMARY.md` (this file)

### No Changes Required To
- JWT token generation (already includes role correctly)
- Authentication filter (working properly)
- Authorization on controller methods (correct permissions)
- User roles in database (OWNER role is valid)

## Additional Notes

### About React StrictMode
React StrictMode is useful for detecting side effects and potential issues, but it can cause problems with HTTP requests. For production builds, this is automatically disabled by Vite/React.

If you want to re-enable StrictMode for development, you'll need to ensure your API calls are properly wrapped in `useEffect` with correct dependencies, or use React Query/SWR which handle duplicate requests better.

### About Error Handling
The `/error` endpoint is Spring Boot's default error handler. It should always be publicly accessible so that error responses can be properly formatted and returned to clients, even when authentication fails.

### Production Considerations
When deploying to production:
1. React StrictMode is automatically disabled in production builds
2. Consider adding proper error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
3. Review all security whitelist entries
4. Ensure proper CORS configuration for your production domain

## Still Having Issues?

If you still see 403 errors after these fixes:

1. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear()
   sessionStorage.clear()
   ```
   Then refresh the page (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

2. **Check your JWT token**:
   Open browser console and run:
   ```javascript
   const token = localStorage.getItem('accessToken');
   const payload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split('.')[1]));
   console.log('Role:', payload.role);
   console.log('Expiry:', new Date(payload.exp * 1000));
   ```
   Verify that:
   - Role is set to "OWNER"
   - Token is not expired

3. **Log out and log back in** to get a fresh token

4. **Check backend logs** for detailed error messages

## Questions?

If you encounter any issues or need clarification, check:
- Backend logs: `tail -f backend.log`
- Frontend logs: Browser DevTools Console
- Network requests: Browser DevTools Network tab

The detailed authentication logging is still enabled, so you can see exactly what's happening with each request.
